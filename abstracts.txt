The galaxy-wide stellar initial mass function (gwIMF) of a galaxy in dependence of its metallicity and star formation rate (SFR) can be calculated by the integrated galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory. Lacchin et al. (2019) apply the IGIMF theory for the first time to study the chemical evolution of the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) satellite galaxies and failed to reproduce the data. Here, we find that the IGIMF theory is naturally consistent with the data. We apply the time-evolving gwIMF calculated at each timestep. The number of type Ia supernova explosions per unit stellar mass formed is renormalised according to the gwIMF. The chemical evolution of Bo\"otes I, one of the best observed UFD, is calculated. Our calculation suggests a mildly bottom-light and top-light gwIMF for Bo\"otes I, and that this UFD has the same gas-consumption timescale as other dwarfs but was quenched about 0.1 Gyr after formation, being consistent with independent estimations and similar to Dragonfly 44. The recovered best fitting input parameters in this work are not covered in the work of Lacchin et al. (2019), creating the discrepancy between our conclusions. In addition, a detailed discussion of uncertainties is presented addressing how the results of chemical evolution models depend on applied assumptions. This study demonstrates the power of the IGIMF theory in understanding the star-formation in extreme environments and shows that UDFs are a promising pathway to constrain the variation of the low-mass stellar IMF.
